# THE MAGICAL DEPLOY DASHBOARD WOOOOOOOOOO

This is a humble yet beautiful dashboard to show how often we deploy, and what
the contents of those deploys are.


## TODO

[] Pull title and description from commit if the deploy commit isn't a pr merge
[] use an actual db ya mook (but still use a seed file of some kind i guess)
[] literally all of the ui lol
