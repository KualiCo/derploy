# THE MAGICAL DEPLOY DASHBOARD WOOOOOOOOOO

This is a humble yet beautiful dashboard to show how often we deploy, and what
the contents of those deploys are.


## TODO

[x] format relative dates on deploys
[x] remove extra quotes on relative time formatting
[ ] get initial current time faster so we don't have to update every second
[x] get current date
[ ] get current week
[ ] handle errors somewhere in the ui
[ ] on click, expand row to fill the whole panel
[x] Pull title and description from commit if the deploy commit isn't a pr merge
[x] sort the deploys by time
[ ] add an endpoint to get stats for past weeks
[x] use an actual db ya mook (but still use a seed file of some kind i guess)
[x] use real config instead of hard-coded tokens that i have to expire now


local todos:

[x] why do the commits not show up?
[ ] make deploy expand and collapse
[ ] format expanded deploy correctly
[ ] make commits expand and collapse
