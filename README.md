# THE MAGICAL DEPLOY DASHBOARD WOOOOOOOOOO

This is a humble yet beautiful dashboard to show how often we deploy, and what
the contents of those deploys are.


## TODO

[x] format relative dates on deploys
[x] remove extra quotes on relative time formatting
[]  get initial current time faster so we don't have to update every second
[x] get current date
[]  get current week
[]  add click handler to display a deploy not as a row but as a panel
[x] Pull title and description from commit if the deploy commit isn't a pr merge
[]  sort the deploys by time
[]  add an endpoint to get stats for past weeks
[]  use an actual db ya mook (but still use a seed file of some kind i guess)
[]  use real config instead of hard-coded tokens that i have to expire now
